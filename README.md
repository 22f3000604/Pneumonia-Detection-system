Pneumonia Detection System (Chest X‑Ray)
A deep learning project that detects pneumonia from chest X‑ray images using a CNN built from scratch. It includes training utilities and an inference app to run predictions on new X‑ray images.

Features
CNN model built from scratch for binary classification (Pneumonia vs Normal).

Training pipeline (data loading, preprocessing, training, evaluation).

Inference/prediction app for testing on new images.

Lightweight repo setup (dataset and trained weights excluded by default).
